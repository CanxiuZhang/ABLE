proof of concept for using bluefruit nrf51 to send values to nodejs application running noble


noble/nodejs code is on the mac mini (couldn't get noble compiling on this comp)

noble/nodejs code based from this example:

https://github.com/tigoe/BluetoothLE-Examples  -> noble -> subscribeExample
-> changed characteristic uuid to target the Heart rate monitor one (matching the arduino sketch), and the characteristic to matc '2a37'

-- the above is old....
